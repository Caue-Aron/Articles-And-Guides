      <h3>About this document...</h3>
      <p>
        Howdy! This small document is meant to quickly tell you on
        <b>how I format and write</b> articles and guides. Throughout my journey
        at the academy, at work and at life in general, I mostly only found
        reading resources that didn't met my needs. Most were very bloated,
        badly written, with colors so bad that I felt like I was about to unlock
        a Sharingan! All those experiences made me realise I couldn't make the
        same mistake and this document is here to prove this all!
      </p>

      <h3>What you'll find here:</h3>
      <p>
        Here you'll find a quick and objective explanation of all the visual,
        structural and (theoretical/mind...? idk, help me explain this one ai
        chat bot) elements I usually use when writing. Somethings are just
        obvious and can be understood just by looking and reading along, like
        how the only way I highligh is with
        <b>bold</b> and alike. So, without further ado...
      </p>

      <h1>Visual Elements</h1>
      <h2>Text Blocks</h2>
      <h3>You're looking at one right now!</h3>
      <p>
        I like to write this way, separating everything into chunks and naming
        them so that you know ahead of time what you'll read and decide if it's
        worth reading or not. Yes, somethings are not meant to be read! I love
        text resources because they're really fast to look through as a
        <b>cheat-sheet</b>. In short, writing in this way assures that you'll
        always know what you'll read. And since you know what you'll read, you
        can
        <b>decide if you should read it or not</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Blocks are necessary because <b>I'm direct and honest</b></h3>
      <p>
        When I say I'll talk about a topic, you best believe I'll talk about it!
        You best believe there will be a whole paragraph on that subject and
        It'll be completelly on you if read it and felt your time wasted at the
        end! Buddy, you were warned about it!
      </p>

      <h3>This is how much I love sushi</h3>
      <p>
        I literally love sushi! Even tho I'm brazilian and I also enjoy meals
        like churrasco, coxinha, feijoada and so on, my favorite on this whole
        earth is sushi! I have always been a huge fan of fish in general and
        when I took notice that they were wrapping it around a sea-lettuce and
        putting weird stuff on top I knew it was the ultimate food right there.
        Funny enough, the first time I had sushi at 9 year old, I actually hated
        it! Can you believe it? Yeah, I literally took a bite and refused it! I
        would only get to try it again years after when I was about 17 years
        old. Since then, I have eat sushi whenever possible.

      <div class="block safe">
        <div>
          <h3>You better do this:</h3>
          <p>
            Literally, it's the best decision to do what t his block tells. And
            if it isn't, call me and we can fact check it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="block warning">
        <div>
          <h3 class="">Don't say I didn't warn you</h3>
          <p class="">
            Text blocks in yellow represent a block with content meant to inform
            you about dangerous practices or actions with high risks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="block danger">
        <div>
          <h3>This is dangerous!</h3>
          <p>
            This block is telling you about actions that you shouldn't be doing
            ever!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="block personal">
        <div>
          <h3>IMHO</h3>
          <p>
            This is a IMHO block. IMHO, everything I write is written based IMHO
            - unless it is a fact or equivalent - but, whenever something
            appears inside this block, it means it's something I personally do
            or recommend doing.

      <h2>Simple Visuals</h2>
      <h3>Easy to understand - easy to create too!</h3>
      <p>
        Heres a random diagram that shows more or less the levels of power
        scaling I'll be using here:
      </p>
      <img
        style="width: 35vw"
        src="linked-list.svg"
        alt="The image is a simple linked-list diagram with three rectangles labeled 'Actors 1', '2', and '3'. Each has a colored border: green (first), white-yellow (second), and dashed red (third). A green dashed arrow with a circular tip connects Actors 1 and 2, while a solid white arrow links Actors 2 and 3. The minimalist design reflects the author's focus on accessibility - he's also the one who's writing all of this! He has a heck of a story with blindness accessability!"
      />
      <p>
        As you can see, I'm a simple person and I take that simplicity to
        everything. Don't expect fancy visuals,
        <b>expect good, competent and easy-to-read visuals.</b>
      </p>
