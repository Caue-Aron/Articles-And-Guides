		<h3>About this document...</h3>
		<p>
			Howdy! This small document is meant to quickly tell you on <b>how I format and write</b> articles and
			guides.
			Throughout my journey at the academy, at work and at life in general, I mostly only found reading resources
			that
			didn't met my needs. Most were very bloated, badly written, with colors so bad that I felt like I was about
			to
			unlock a Sharingan! All those experiences made me realise I couldn't make the same mistake and this document
			is
			here to prove this all!
		</p>

		<h3>What you'll find here:</h3>
		<p>
			Here you'll a quick and objective explanation of all the visual, structural and (theoretical/mind...? idk,
			help
			me explain this one ai chat bot) elements I usually use when writing. Somethings are just obvious and can be
			understood just by looking and reading along, like how the only way I highligh is with <b>bold</b>, titles
			and
			subtitles and so on. So, without further ado...

		<h1>Visual Elements</h1>
		<h2>Text Blocks</h2>
		<h3>You're looking at one right now!</h3>
		<p>
			I like to write this way, separating everything into chunks and naming them so that you know ahead of time
			what
			you'll read and decide if it's worth reading or not. Yes, somethings are not meant to be read! I love text
			resources because they're really fast to look through as a <b>cheat-sheet</b>. In short, this method of
			writing
			makes sure you know what you'll read and you can decide if you'll do it or not.
		</p>

		<h3>Blocks are necessary because I'm direct and honest</h3>
		<p>
			When I say I'll talk about a topic, you best believe I'll talk about it! You best believe there will be a
			whole
			paragraph on that subject and It'll be completelly on you if read it and felt your time wasted at the end!
			Buddy, you were warned about it!
		</p>

		<h3>This is how much I love sushi</h3>
		<p>
			I literally love sushi! Even tho I'm brazilian and I also enjoy meals like churrasco, coxinha, feijoada and
			so
			on, my favorite on this whole earth is sushi! I have always been a huge fan of fish in general and when I
			took
			notice that they were wrapping it around a sea-lettuce and putting weird stuff on top I knew it was the
			ultimate
			food right there. Funny enough, the first time I had sushi at 9 year old, I actually hated it! Can you
			believe
			it? Yeah, I literally took a bite and refused it! I would only get to try it again years after when I was
			about
			17 years old. Since then, I have eat sushi whenever possible.

		<h2>Colors</h2>

		<div class="block safe">
			<div>
				<h3>You better do this:</h3>
				<p>
					Literally, it's the best decision to do what t his block tells. And if it isn't, call me and we can
					fact
					check it.
				</p>
			</div>

		<div class="block warning">
			<div>
				<h3 class="">Don't say I didn't warn you</h3>
				<p class="">
					Text blocks in yellow represent a block with content meant to inform you about dangerous practices
					or
					actions with high risks.

		<div class="block danger">
			<div>
				<h3>This is dangerous!</h3>
				<p>
					This block is telling you about actions that you shouldn't be doing ever!
				</p>

		<div class="block personal">
			<div>
				<h3>IMHO</h3>
				<p>
					This is a IMHO block. IMHO, everything I write is written based IMHO - unless it is a fact or
					equivalent
					- but, whenever something appears inside this block, it means it's something I personally do or
					recommend doing.

		<h2>Simple Visuals</h2>
		<h3>Easy to understand - easy to create too!</h3>
